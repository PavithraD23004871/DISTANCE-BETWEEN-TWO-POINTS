# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
Start the program

### Step 2:
Assign the values for the variables x2,x1,y2,y1

### Step 3:
Substitute the values in the distance formula formula

### Step 4:
Print the distance using format to display the answer with two decimal points

### Step 5:
End the program
### PROGRAM:
```
#Program to find the distance between two points.
#Developed by:PAVITHRA.D 
#RegisterNumber:23004871
import math
l1=[4,2]
l2=[10,6]
distance=math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
```

### OUTPUT:
![Distance](https://github.com/PavithraD23004871/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/assets/138955967/9bd88b41-df60-4855-8bf3-7862b68e21f7)

### RESULT:
Thus the program are executed successfully
